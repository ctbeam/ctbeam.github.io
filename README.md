This project was used to create the bones of our portfolio page for the assignments we are being given in the class. We utilized a multitude of different items for coding an html page. We utilized Bootstrap to put together a nav bar as well as the rows for the portfolio page. I utilzed an assets folder to use personalized photos and images to personalize my page.
